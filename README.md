# E-commerce Fraud Transaction Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing fraud transactions in an e-commerce dataset. The goal is to preprocess the data using Google Colab, store it in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) BigQuery with the table name "fraud_dataset," and visualize the results using Google Looker Studio.

## Data Source

The source dataset is obtained from Kaggle: [E-commerce Fraud Data](https://www.kaggle.com/aryanrastogi7767/ecommerce-fraud-data)

## Environment Setup

### Google Colab

- Use Google Colab notebooks for data preprocessing.
- Execute the code in the provided Colab notebook (`E_commerce_Fraud_Project.ipynb`) for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.

### GCP BigQuery

- Create a BigQuery dataset and table named "fraud_dataset" to store the preprocessed data.
- Load the data from Colab to BigQuery for further analysis.

### Google Looker Studio

- Set up a connection to BigQuery in Google Looker Studio.
- Create visualizations and dashboards for fraud transaction analysis.

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary credentials and permissions to access GCP services.
- Replace sensitive information such as GCP credentials, project details, and Kaggle API keys before sharing the code or notebook.
